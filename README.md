# Crypto Buddy Backend

## Description

This backend system serves as the core engine for the "Crypto Buddy" application. It is responsible for processing and storing cryptocurrency-related data obtained from the web scraper, applying sentiment analysis to articles, and offering API endpoints for data access and retrieval. The backend is structured around the NestJS framework, using TypeScript for a type-safe coding experience.

## Features

- **Database Connection:** Establishes a persistent connection to the chosen database to store and retrieve articles, their metadata, and sentiment scores.
- **NLP Integration:** Leverages modern NLP tools to deduce sentiment from the content of articles and scores them accordingly.
- **API Endpoints:** Comprehensive CRUD operations for articles, along with specialized endpoints to handle scraped data and sentiment-processed results.
- **Scheduled Processing:** Periodic tasks to sieve through unprocessed articles and evaluate them using NLP tools.
